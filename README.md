## Overview

NFT Recommender Engine leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to offer highly personalized NFT purchase recommendations. This product is designed to be integrated with NFT marketplaces, enhancing user experience by tailoring suggestions based on an in-depth analysis of their behavior patterns, Solana balance, transaction history, and current NFT holdings.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Utilizes a complex recommender model to analyze users' digital wallet activities, categorizing them into distinct patterns for accurate NFT suggestions.
- **Wallet Analysis**: Fetches the Solana balance, transaction history, and existing NFT collection to recommendation best buys.
- **Future-Ready**: Initial focus on NFT recommendations, with plans to expand into broader financial Recommender Engine within the Solana ecosystem and beyond.

## How It Works

1. **Integration**: Easily integrates with a platform's existing infrastructure, requiring minimal setup.
2. **Data Fetching**: Once a user connects their digital wallet, the system fetches relevant data points such as Solana balance, transaction history, and current NFT portfolio.
3. **Analysis & Categorization**: The ML model analyzes the fetched data, categorizing the user into a specific behavior pattern.
4. **Recommendation Generation**: Based on the categorization, the system generates a list of the top NFTs recommended for purchase.
5. **Continuous Learning**: The model continually learns from new user data, ensuring recommendations become more accurate over time.
